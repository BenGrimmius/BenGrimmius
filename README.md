## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is Ben, and I am an alumni of LearningFuze in Irvine California. I pursue software development as a way to enrich the lives of individuals around the world. 
I thrive when working alongside a collaborative and transparent team that shares passion in what we do. I am looking to gain a position as a front-end software engineer with a team that loves what we do.
Happy to connect!
